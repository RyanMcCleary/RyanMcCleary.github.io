<h1>A Brief Summary of The Adventures of Odysseus</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The events of the Odyssey began with the Trojan War, which concluded 
after the Greeks captured Troy by tricking the Trojans with the famous Trojan Horse.
The Trojan War was covered in depth in The Illiad, of wuich The Odyssey is a sequel.
This page is not meant to be a comprehensive summary of all of the events of
the Odyssey; rather, it is meant as a short overview of some of the more interesting
adventures of the Greek hero Odysseus.
</p>
<h2>The Island of the Lotus-Eaters</h2>
<p>
At the end of the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men were blown off course by a
storm after raiding the town of Ismaros.
They eventually landed on "the land 
of the Lotus-Eaters, which was an island inhabited by a tribe of people who 
ate lotus flowers. He sent a group of three of his men to scout the island, but 
they did not return. After waiting for some time, Odysseus went out himself to 
see what the problem was. He discovered that the Lotus-Eaters had offered his 
men some of their food, which was so delicious that they forgot about their 
homes and had no desire to do anything other than stay on the island and eat 
the lotus flowers. Odysseus dragged them forcefully back to the boat and him 
and his men left at once, before any more of them could eat the Lotus.
</p>
<h2>The Island of the Cyclopes</h2>
<p>
After narrowly escaping the island of the Lotus-Eaters, Odysseus and 
his men came upon another island. This time, though, the island was not 
inhabited by peaceful Lotus-Eaters; it was inhabited by a tribe of Cyclopes 
(one-eyed, man-eating giants). The biggest and most cruel of these giants was 
named Polyphemus. Odysseus and his men saw a cave with food and water inside, 
and not knowing the cave was the lair of Polyphemus, they went inside, ate and 
drank their fill, and went to sleep. Later the same day, Polyphemus returned to 
his cave and became very angry. He killed two of the men and ate them, and then 
went to sleep. The next day, Polyphemus devoured two more of Odysseus's men and 
went out to herd his sheep. While Polyphemus was away, Odysseus devised a plan: 
he acquired a long, sharp stake and hid it before Polyphemus returned. When the 
cyclopse finally did return, Odysseus gave to him a very strong wine that he 
had brought with him. Polyphemus became so inebriated that he immediately fell 
asleep. While Polyphemus was sleeping, Odysseus pot the sharp stake in a fire 
and drove it into Polyphemus's eye, blinding him. When Polyphemus awoke, he 
couldn't catch Odysseus or his men, since he was blind. The next day, Odysseus 
and his crew escaped by tying themselves under the bellies of Polyphemus's 
goats. Polyphemus felt the backs of the goats to make sure that no one was 
riding on them, but he didn't think to check their bellies. When they were 
safely out of the cave, Odysseus and his men ran to their ships and escaped. 
When he was escaping, Odysseus told Polyphemus his name. This turned out to be 
a very bad decision, because Polyphemus's father was Poseidon, the sea god, who 
became furious at Odysseus when Polyphemus told him that Odysseus blinded him.  
For the remainder of Odysseus's journey, Poseidon did everything he could to 
make Odysseus's life miserable.

<h2>The Laestrygonians</h2>
<p>
Later on their journey, Odysseus's fleet arrived at the harbor of an 
island inhabited by the Laestrygonians, a tribe of man-eating giants (unlike 
the Cyclopes, they each had two eyes). Eleven of the twelve ships in Odysseus's 
fleet were destroyed with rocks thrown by the Laestrygonians off of high 
cliffs. Odysseus's ship was the only one to survive.
</p>
<h2>The Sorceress Circe</h2>
<p>
With only one ship remaining, Odysseus sailed on to the island of  
Aeaea, which was inhabited by the Sorceress Circe. As it happened, Circe was 
very fond of turning people into animals. Her mansion on the island was 
surrounded by various animals, all of which were the victims of her magic. A 
party consisting of half of odysseus's men entered the mansion and were given 
food and wine. After they were done their meal, Circe turned them into pigs. 
Only one of the party was able to escape. He ran back to Odysseus and told him 
what had befallen the rest of the men. Odysseus immediately set out for the 
mansion to see what he could do to rescue them. On his way, he was stopped by 
Hermes, who gave him a potion that would make him immune to Circes magic. Using 
this potion, Odysseus managed to force Circe to change the pigs back into men. 
Odysseus and his crew stayed on the island for an entire year before setting 
out for Ithica again. During that time, Circe advised them of the perils ahead: 
to return home, Odysseus would have to sail between the two monsters, Scylla 
and Charybdis.
</p>
<h2>Scylla and Charybdis</h2>
<p>
Scylla and Charybdis were monsters said to be located on either side of the Strait of Messina.
monster living on a high Scylla was a six-headed, twelve-footed rock on one side of
the strait, and Charybdis was a whirlpool on the other side. They were close enough
together so that a boat trying to pass between them would have no choice but to face one of
them; if Odysseus steered his ship away from Scylla, he would come dangerously
close to Charybdis, and vice versa. He decided to steer his boat toward Scylla because
he would rather lose a few sailors to the six-headed monster than his entire boat to
a whirlpool. Odysseus ended up losing six men (one was eaten by each head of Scylla),
but the losses were nowhere near as extreme as they could have been. The myth of Scylla and
Charybdis has spawned several idioms, two of them being "between Scylla and Charybdis" and
"between a rock and a hard place". Both of these refer the a choice between two dangerous
alternatives.

<h2>Calypso</h2>
<p>
A short time later, Odysseus's ship landed on the island of Thrinacia. On that island,
Odysseus's sailors were warned not to eat the sacred cattle of Helios. Despite the warnings,
they killed and ate several of the sacred cattle when their food supply ran short.
Helios asked Zeus to punish them for eating the cattle, so Zeus wrecked Odysseus's ship in a storm and
all of the sailors were killed. Odysseus was the only one who survived. He washed up on the
island of Ogygia, where the Nymph Calypso, the daughter of Atlas, lived. Calypso put Odysseus under
a spell and kept him prisoner on the island for seven years as her husband. She would have kept
him permanently is Athena had not asked Zeus to release him. Zeus sent Hermes, the messenger god,
to tell Calypso that Odysseus needed to be released. Odysseus made a raft and sailed from the island.
